Year 2 Semester 1 Introduction To Python Programming Assignment 

Project Overview:

A task to creating a comprehensive Python-based grading system that
will be developed over several weeks. The final product should be a fully functional 
application capable of managing students' grades, performing various 
operations such as adding, removing, searching, sorting, and printing student 
records. The project should build up incrementally, starting from basic scalar
operations and loops and progressing to more advanced concepts like
compound data structures, functions, classes, exception handling, and algorithms.
